This is a two part test. The first part is to write a very simple chat bot with some very specific canned responses. The
second is to write a realtime chat application to interface with the chat bot. The required technologies here are Ruby, Coffeescript / Javscript outside of that you may use any gems or npm modules to assist in the completion.

Ruby
===

This is a simple evaluation problem. You'll code Bob, a simple message responder as follows:

* Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.
* He answers 'Woah, chill out!' if you yell at him (ALL CAPS).
* He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying anything.
* He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.
* Write tests to asset the above is working correctly.

*Do not use “if”, “unless” or “case” in your response code.*

Coffeescript / Javascript
===

This is a simple real time, browser based chat room to interface with Bob as follows:

* Public Lobby - Each user joining the lobby should be assigned a numbered username (e.g. User1234).
* Private Messages - Each user should be able to send/receive private messages.
* Bob should be able to listen, and respond to both the public lobby, and his own private messages.
* Write tests to assess the above is working correctly.
